# Resep Bunda Changelog - 2025-12-22

## Overview
**Review Date**: December 22, 2025
**Tasks Processed**: 1
**Project Status**: Foundation successfully established with React Native/Expo setup

## Changes Made

### Task Completions
- **0.1 - Init RN project + dependencies**: Status changed from "Need Review" to "Done"
  - React Native project successfully initialized with Expo SDK 54.0.30
  - All core dependencies properly installed and configured
  - Project structure follows React Native/Expo best practices
  - Database client and theme system implemented
  - Navigation system with Expo Router properly configured

## Project Progress

### Milestone Achievements
- Project foundation completed with proper React Native/Expo setup
- Database architecture initialized with SQLite client
- Authentication system foundation established
- Navigation structure implemented with file-based routing

### Metrics Updates
- **Completion Rate**: 2% (1 of 74 tasks completed)
- **Code Quality Score**: Good
- **Foundation Status**: Complete

### Areas of Progress
- Core technology stack properly configured (Expo SDK 54, TypeScript, SQLite)
- Project structure optimized for maintainability and scalability
- Theme system established with consistent design tokens
- Database abstraction layer implemented with backward compatibility
- File-based navigation system with authentication guards

## Upcoming Focus Areas
1. Complete TypeScript interfaces for Recipe data models (Task 0.3)
2. Implement Recipe schema in SQLite database (Task 0.4)
3. Set up navigation structure (Task 0.2)
4. Begin authentication screen implementation (Task 1.1)

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts**:
- Solid foundation established for all future development
- Proper tooling and configuration in place for team productivity
- Scalable architecture implemented for feature growth
- Type safety ensured with TypeScript configuration

**Areas of Concern**:
- Recipe data model interfaces still need implementation
- SQLite schema needs Recipe table for core functionality
- Constants directory structure could be more standardized

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Foundation setup is robust and follows best practices
- Database client includes backward compatibility for API changes
- TypeScript strict mode enabled to catch issues early
- Comprehensive gitignore prevents accidental commits of sensitive files

## Technical Debt
- Missing Recipe TypeScript interfaces (to be addressed in Task 0.3)
- Recipe schema not yet implemented in SQLite (to be addressed in Task 0.4)
- Theme constants could be better organized (low priority)

## Quality Assurance
- ESLint configuration properly set up with Expo standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for type safety
- Git workflow and ignore patterns configured correctly
- Development scripts available for common tasks
